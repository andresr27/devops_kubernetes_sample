# Core Infrastructure as Code

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing core cloud infrastructure following industry best practices. The infrastructure is organized in a layered approach, ensuring separation of concerns, environment isolation, and maintainability.

## Architecture Philosophy

We follow a **layer-based separation** pattern:

- **Core Layer**: Foundational network and security infrastructure
- **Middleware Layer**: Shared services and platform components
- **Application Layer**: Environment-specific application infrastructure

This separation allows different teams to work concurrently while maintaining clear boundaries and ownership.

## Infrastructure Components

### Core Layer
- **VPC Networking**: Multi-AZ VPC with public, private, and isolated subnets
- **Network Security**: Security groups, NACLs, and network segmentation
- **Identity & Access Management**: IAM roles and policies with least privilege
- **DNS Management**: Route53 hosted zones and record sets

### Middleware Layer
- **Kubernetes Cluster**: EKS cluster with managed node groups
- **Database Services**: RDS PostgreSQL with high availability setup
- **Caching Layer**: Elasticache Redis clusters
- **Message Queues**: SQS queues and SNS topics

### Application Layer
- **Containerized Applications**: ECS/EKS services and deployments
- **Load Balancers**: ALB/NLB configurations
- **Monitoring & Logging**: CloudWatch alarms and dashboards
- **CI/CD Integration**: CodePipeline and CodeBuild configurations

## Environment Strategy

We maintain three distinct environments:

1. **Development**: For active development and testing
2. **Staging**: For pre-production validation and testing
3. **Production**: For live customer traffic

Each environment has its own configuration while sharing common foundational patterns.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Terraform 1.5.0 or later
- AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials
- Git for version control

### Initial Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd terraform-core-infra
   ```

2. **Configure remote state storage**
   ```bash
   # Create S3 bucket for Terraform state
   aws s3 mb s3://your-company-terraform-state
   
   # Create DynamoDB table for state locking
   aws dynamodb create-table --table-name terraform-locks \
     --attribute-definitions AttributeName=LockID,AttributeType=S \
     --key-schema AttributeName=LockID,KeyType=HASH \
     --billing-mode PAY_PER_REQUEST
   ```

3. **Initialize Terraform**
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

### Environment Deployment

Deploy to development environment:
```bash
terraform workspace select development
terraform plan -var-file=environments/development/terraform.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=environments/development/terraform.tfvars
```

Deploy to production environment:
```bash
terraform workspace select production
terraform plan -var-file=environments/production/terraform.tfvars
terraform apply -var-file=environments/production/terraform.tfvars
```

## Workflow & Best Practices

### Version Control
- Use feature branches for infrastructure changes
- Require PR reviews for all changes to main branch
- Use semantic commit messages
- Tag releases for production deployments

### Change Management
1. **Plan**: Always run `terraform plan` before apply
2. **Review**: Peer review all infrastructure changes
3. **Test**: Validate changes in development/staging first
4. **Document**: Update documentation for significant changes

### Security Practices
- Use IAM roles with least privilege principle
- Regularly rotate credentials and access keys
- Enable encryption at rest and in transit
- Implement network segmentation and security zones

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Routine Checks
- Weekly review of CloudTrail logs for anomalous activity
- Monthly cost optimization and resource cleanup
- Quarterly security audit and compliance checks

### Disaster Recovery
- Regular backups of critical state and databases
- Documented recovery procedures for all components
- Regular disaster recovery drills

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

## Support

For infrastructure issues or questions:

1. Check existing documentation in `/docs`
2. Review Terraform plan output for configuration issues
3. Create an issue in the repository with:
    - Terraform version
    - AWS region
    - Error messages or logs
    - Steps to reproduce
