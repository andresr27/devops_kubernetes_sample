      This documentation provides comprehensive insights into our cloud infrastructure architecture, built on AWS using Terraform following industry best practices and a layered approach.

      Our infrastructure is designed with **scalability**, **security**, and **maintainability** as core principles. We follow a modular, layer-based approach that enables team autonomy while maintaining consistency across environments.

              A[Core Layer] --> B[Middleware Layer]
              B --> C[Application Layer]
          end

          subgraph A {
              A1[VPC Networking]

      ### Layer-Based Separation
      We maintain clear separation between different infrastructure concerns:

      - **Core Layer**: Foundational network and security infrastructure
      - **Middleware Layer**: Shared platform services and components
      - **Application Layer**: Business-specific applications and services

      ### Environment Strategy
      We support three distinct environments with isolated configurations:

      - **Development**: For active development and experimentation
      - **Staging**: For pre-production validation and testing
      - **Production**: For live customer traffic with highest availability

  - title: "üöÄ Quick Start"
    content: |
      ### Prerequisites
      - Terraform 1.5.0+
      - AWS CLI configured
      - Git for version control

      ### Initial Deployment
      ```bash
      # Clone the repository
      git clone <repository-url>
      cd terraform-core-infra

      # Initialize Terraform
      terraform init

      # Deploy to development
      terraform workspace select development
      terraform apply -var-file=environments/development/terraform.tfvars
      ```
